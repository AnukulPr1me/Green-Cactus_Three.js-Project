# Green Cactus_Three.js Project

Welcome to my second Three.js project! In this project, I've taken my skills with Three.js to the next level to create an even more immersive and interactive 3D scene. This project showcases advanced 3D models, stunning visual effects, and captivating user interactions.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the steps below to clone the repository and run it using npm command-line:

### Prerequisites

Before you proceed, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm (Node Package Manager)

### Cloning the Repository

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Change the current working directory to where you want to store the project.

3. Run the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your project's repository.

4. Once the cloning process is complete, change the directory to the project's root folder:

```bash
cd <project_folder>
```

Replace `<project_folder>` with the name of the folder created during the cloning process.

### Installing Dependencies

Next, you need to install the project's dependencies (such as Three.js) using npm. In the project's root folder, run:

```bash
npm install
```

This command will fetch and install all the required packages listed in the `package.json` file.

### Running the Project

With the dependencies installed, you are now ready to run the Three.js project. In the project's root folder, run the following npm command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server, and you should see a message indicating that the project is running and on which port it's being served (e.g., http://localhost:3000).

### Viewing the Project

Open your web browser and enter the URL provided by the npm start command (e.g., http://localhost:3000). You should now see my second Three.js project rendered in your browser.

### Interacting with the Project

Feel free to interact with the 3D scene! I've included various interactive elements that respond to user input. Explore the scene, try clicking on objects, and discover how the visuals react to different actions.

## Additional Information

Include any additional information or features about your project here. For example, you might want to mention specific controls for interacting with the scene or how to toggle different modes or effects.

## Credits

Give credit to any resources, tutorials, or assets used in your project. If you used any third-party libraries or models, mention them here.

I hope you enjoy exploring my second Three.js project! I had a great time building it and experimenting with various 3D elements. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out. Happy coding!
