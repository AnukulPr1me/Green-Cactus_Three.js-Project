                <h3> Do you know anything about me? </h3>
                <p>The cactus plant, a true survivor of harsh environments,
                    is a marvel of nature's ingenuity. Its distinctive appearance,
                    with fleshy, water-storing stems and spines, allows it to thrive 
                    in arid regions where few other plants can survive. With an incredible 
                    ability to conserve water, cacti can withstand scorching temperatures 
                    and prolonged droughts.</p>

                <h2>How we survive?</h2>
                <h3>Why we have long roots? <br>Can all cacti have flowers?</h3>
                <p>Long Roots in Plants: Long roots serve multiple vital functions for plants,<br>
                    including anchoring them securely in the soil, accessing water and nutrients<br> 
                    from deeper layers, aiding in soil erosion prevention, and enhancing their<br> 
                    ability to survive in various environmental conditions.<br>
                    Cacti and Flowers: While not all cacti produce flowers, many species do.<br> 
                    The flowering ability varies depending on factors such as cactus species,<br> 
                    age, and environmental conditions. Cacti flowers play a crucial ecological <br>
                    role by attracting pollinators, leading to fruit and seed formation, and<br> 
                    contributing to the plant's reproductive success. The diverse and often <br>
                    striking flowers of cacti add a touch of beauty to the arid landscapes they inhabit.
